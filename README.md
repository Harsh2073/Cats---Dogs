# Cat vs. Dog Classification Using SVM

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset is preprocessed using image resizing, normalization, and feature extraction techniques before being fed into the SVM classifier.

# 🔧 Features
- Data Preprocessing: Convert images to grayscale, resize, and normalize.
- Feature Extraction: Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or raw pixel values.
- SVM Model Training: Train an SVM model with different kernels (linear, RBF, etc.).
- Evaluation: Compute accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Prediction: Classify new images as either a cat or a dog.
